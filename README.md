# VRND-P01-SteamVR
A version of Project 01 for Udacity's VRND made for use with SteamVR

I have removed the `GoogleVR` asset and added in `SteamVR` and `VRTK` assets. The menu does not work yet. The "Spawn cubes" function is currently triggered by the trigger button on the right Vive controller. I have also moved the text so that it is in a more comfortable position to view from when facing the computer (while using Unity).
